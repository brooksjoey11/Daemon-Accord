# Accord Engine - One Pager

**Policy-Driven Web Automation Platform**

---

## The Problem

Organizations need to monitor, extract, and validate web content at scale, but face three critical challenges:

1. **Manual Monitoring is Expensive:** Teams spend 10-20 hours/week manually checking pages for changes, new content, or downtime
2. **Error-Prone Processes:** Manual checks miss changes, introduce errors, and don't scale
3. **No Compliance Controls:** Existing tools lack policy controls, audit trails, and authorization management

**Result:** High operational costs, missed changes, compliance risks, and inability to scale.

---

## The Solution

**Accord Engine** is a policy-driven automation platform that:

- ✅ **Automates Web Monitoring:** Monitor pages for changes, extract structured data, verify uptime
- ✅ **Policy-Controlled:** Domain allowlist/denylist, rate limits, concurrency controls, authorization-based access
- ✅ **Fully Audited:** Complete audit trail of all decisions and actions
- ✅ **Production-Ready:** Deployable in minutes, runs on 8GB RAM, proven on real targets

**Deployment:** `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d`  
**Proof:** Production Proof Pack validates end-to-end functionality on any fresh VM

## Three Workflows (Ready to Use)

### 1. Page Change Detection

**Problem:** Need to know when public pages (documentation, terms, pricing) change

**Solution:** Automated monitoring with hash-based change detection and webhook alerts

**Use Cases:**
- Legal compliance monitoring (terms of service changes)
- Competitive intelligence (pricing page monitoring)
- Documentation updates (API docs, guides)
- Content change detection (announcements, updates)

**Value:** Eliminates 5-10 hours/week of manual checking

### 2. Job Posting Monitor

**Problem:** Need to track job postings across multiple job boards

**Solution:** Automated extraction of structured job data with keyword filtering and alerts

**Use Cases:**
- Recruitment monitoring (track competitor hiring)
- Market research (job market trends)
- Talent acquisition (new opportunities)
- Competitive intelligence (team expansion tracking)

**Value:** Replaces 8-15 hours/week of manual job board monitoring

### 3. Uptime/UX Smoke Check

**Problem:** Need to verify pages load correctly with required elements

**Solution:** Automated page load verification, selector validation, and screenshot capture

**Use Cases:**
- Uptime monitoring (critical pages)
- Quality assurance (pre-deployment checks)
- Performance monitoring (load time validation)
- Visual regression testing (screenshot comparison)

**Value:** Prevents downtime incidents, reduces QA time by 50%

## Proof Pack

**What It Is:** Buyer-grade evidence bundle that proves the system works end-to-end

**What It Does:**
- Starts all services from scratch
- Submits jobs across all execution strategies (vanilla/stealth/assault)
- Verifies completion and persistence
- Generates timestamped artifacts with SHA256 manifests

**Evidence Provided:**
- ✅ Fresh VM deployment works
- ✅ End-to-end flow validated
- ✅ Multiple strategies tested
- ✅ Real targets (not just example.com)
- ✅ Database persistence verified
- ✅ Reproducible results

**Run It:** `python scripts/proof_pack/run_proof_pack.py`

**Output:** `proof_pack_artifacts/YYYYMMDD-HHMM/` with complete validation evidence
