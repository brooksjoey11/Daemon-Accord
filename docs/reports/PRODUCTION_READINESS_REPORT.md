## Remaining Work (Optional Enhancements)

### Performance Validation (Future)
- Load testing scripts (Locust/Artillery)
- Performance baseline documentation
- Scalability validation

**Note:** Performance validation can be done post-sale as it requires production-like infrastructure.

### Additional Security (Future)
- JWT token support
- OAuth2 integration
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

**Note:** Current security (API keys + rate limiting) is sufficient for most use cases.
