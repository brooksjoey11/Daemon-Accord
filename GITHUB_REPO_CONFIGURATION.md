# GitHub Repository Configuration Guide

**Exact settings for perfect repository creation**

---

## Configuration Settings

### Visibility
**Choose:** ⚪ **Private** (recommended for now)

**Why:**
- You're selling this - don't want it public yet
- Can make public later if needed
- Private allows controlled access for buyers
- Professional approach for commercial code

**Alternative:** Public (if you want it discoverable, but private is safer for sale)

---

### Add README
**Choose:** ⚪ **OFF** (unchecked)

**Why:**
- We already have a professional README.md
- Don't want GitHub's template
- Our README is better than the template

---

### Add .gitignore
**Choose:** ⚪ **OFF** (unchecked)

**Why:**
- We already have a comprehensive .gitignore
- Don't want GitHub's generic template
- Our .gitignore is tailored to this project

---

### Add License
**Choose:** ⚪ **OFF** (unchecked)

**Why:**
- We already have a LICENSE file
- Don't want GitHub's license picker
- Our LICENSE is already in the repo

---

### Connect GitHub Apps
**Choose:** ⚪ **Skip for now** (or leave unchecked)

**Why:**
- Can add apps later if needed
- Not necessary for initial setup
- Keeps it simple
