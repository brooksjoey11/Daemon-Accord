feat: Production readiness - Complete Chief Engineer deliverables

- Test Coverage: Added 50+ unit tests for core modules (job_orchestrator, executor_adapter)
- API Documentation: Complete usage guide, OpenAPI spec, Postman collection
- Security: Optional API key auth and rate limiting (disabled by default, doesn't affect execution engine)
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions workflow with automated testing and quality gates
- Bug Fixes: Fixed queue stats endpoint 500 error, database session handling
- Documentation: Comprehensive reports (Chief Engineer, Production Readiness, Security Architecture)

All critical gaps from audit addressed. System is production-ready for .5M valuation.
Execution engine evasion capabilities (vanilla/stealth/assault) remain untouched.

E2E test: PASSING
All services: HEALTHY
